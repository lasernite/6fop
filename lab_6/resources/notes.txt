Mismatch with lecture that used divide and conquer; students expected to do the same here! Perhaps do L-shaped tiling and N-queens in this lecture; drop merge sort.

Spend 2 weeks on this one?  (It was very hard for students.  Big jump with prior labs.)

Have an intermediate milestone for basic recursion strategy ("design").

More in HINTS file?  ("Start at top-left open space and consider horizontal and vertical pieces to cover it.")

Just use a divide-and-conquer lab here?

Change anchor to top left?  (Or suggest that students might use different representation internally.)
